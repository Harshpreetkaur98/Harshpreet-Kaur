    <h3 class="sub-heads-swe">Overview</h3>
    <p>On 15th November 2023, I participated in an Assessment Centre hosted by Barclays. This event provided a realistic preview of the actual assessment process, helping me to gain valuable insights and reflect on the feedback given by Barclays staff.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heads-swe">Key Learnings</h3>
    <ul class="bullets-swe">
        <li>Gained a deeper understanding of the assessment process and what it entails.</li>
        <li>Received feedback on my performance which I can use to improve in future assessments.</li>
        <li>Learned the importance of being aware of my own story and unique path to success.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub-heads-swe">Networking and Professional Relationships</h3>
    <p>The event also emphasized the importance of leveraging the new network I built and the people I connected with on LinkedIn. Sending them a "Thank You" note and continuing the conversation with specific questions is a great way to start building professional relationships.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heads-swe">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The advice and insights gained from the Barclays staff were invaluable, especially the emphasis on being aware of my own story and unique path. I am now better prepared for future assessments and look forward to applying the feedback and knowledge gained.</p>
